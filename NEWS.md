# heemod devel

## Breaking changes

  * `strategy` becomes a reserved parameter name.
  * Counting method `"half-cycle"` is deprecated.

## New features

  * Transition probabilities from survival models with `get_probs_from_surv()`:
    * Parametrically defined by `define_survival()`.
    * Or fitted on data by the `flexsurv` package.
  * Support for partitioned survival models with `define_part_surv()`.
  * Plot EVPI.
  * Export PSA files for Sheffield Accelerated Value of Information sofware.
  * Individuals can enter the model after the beginning with the `inflow` argument in `run_model()` (mainly for budget impact analysis).
  * Strategy name can be used to define values with `dispatch_strategy()` or using the `strategy` name (vignettes *homogeneous* and *probabilistic* have been updated to use this feature).

## Other features

  * Convenience function `rescale_discount_rate()`.
  * Better error messages at parameter evaluation.

## Backend changes

  * Cleaner handling of clusters.
  * Package `diagram`, `Hmisc` and `logitnorm` moved from `Imports` to `Suggests`.
  
## Bugfixes

  * Fixed bugs that would return incorrect efficiency frontiers in some situations, or would return duplicated strategy names in some edge cases (thanks to [Vince Daniels](https://github.com/daniels4321)).
  * Fixed a failure of tabular input when a column can be read as all numeric.
  
## Acknowledments

  * Thanks to [Matthew Wiener](https://github.com/MattWiener) for the survival analysis code.
  
# heemod 0.7.1

## Bugfixes

  * Fixed an error resulting in incorrect covariance analysis results when relations between values and parameters were negative.

# heemod 0.7.0

## Breaking changes

  * Some plotting arguments changed (e.g. `type`=>`results`).

## New features

  * Added covariance analysis for PSA with `type = "cov"` plot.
  * All plotting functions can now represent multiple strategies with facets.
  * CECA plotted on a log scale by default.
  * Black & white plots for publications with the `bw` plot option.
  * Remove variables that are not sensitive in DSA with `remove_ns`.

## Backend changes

  * Important object structure change (from attributes to lists).
  * More systematic use of getter functions.
  * More standarized processing of model objects.
  * Unit tests rely less on printed results.
  * Using new nomenclature in backend functions (`model`=>`strategy`).
  * `base_strategy` divided in 3 concepts: `central_strategy`, `root_strategy`, `noncomparable_strategy`.
  * Non-heemod versions of `discount()` throw warnings.

# heemod 0.6.0

## Breaking changes

  * Base model cannot be specified anymore: it is always the least costly model.
  * Renamed arguement `transition_matrix` => `transition` in `define_strategy()`.

## New features

  * Parallel computing with `use_cluster()`.
  * Compute average values from PSA.
  
## Bugfixes
  
  * Acceptability curve returns probabilities at 0.
  * Correctly identify efficiency frontier.
  * ICER are computed on the efficiency frontier.
  
## Acknowledments

  * Thanks to [Matthew Wiener](https://github.com/MattWiener), [Zdenek Kabat](https://github.com/zkabat) and [Vojtech Filipec](https://github.com/vojtech-filipec) for their great contributions to this update.

# heemod 0.5.1

## Bugfixes

  * Added `formatR` to suggest list.

# heemod 0.5.0

## Breaking changes

  * Some functions were renamed for clarification:
    *  `define_model()` => `define_strategy()`
    *  `run_models()` => `run_model()`
    *  `define_matrix()` => `define_transition()`
    *  `define_sensitivity()` => `define_dsa()`
    *  `define_distrib()` => `define_psa()`
    *  `run_sensitivity()` => `run_dsa()`
    *  `run_probabilistic()` => `run_psa()`

## New features

  * Values and probabilities can depend on state time with `state_cycle`, allowing to reproduce the results of microsimulations.
  * `define_sensitivity()` now accepts any expression as input, and can call references to model parameteres.
  * Discount rates can now be specified as parameters (allows for rates to be modified in DSA & PSA).
  * Any state value can be plotted.
  * Additional output: csv files for many of the tabular results.
  
## Bugfixes

  * Edges where P=0 are not plotted anymore for transition matrices.
  * There used to be a potential error when you wanted to save output but there had been no psa.

# heemod 0.4.0

## New features

  * `update()` for heterogeneity analysis and to compute population-level values, with vignette.
  * `run_models_tabular()` to import models from tabular input, with vignette.
  * `look_up()` to look up values from external data.
  * Added option to pool female and male mortality rates in WHO data.
  * Counting method now defaults to life-table.
  * `plot_sensitivity()` now plots by default the widest bar on top.
  * Convenience functions for converting rates to probabilities.
  * Models can be run without state values, to compute counts only.
  * Much more informative error messages.
  * Objects can be converted to the `R` code to generate them (same idea as `dput()`, but easier to read).
  * New options `heemod.verbose` and `heemod.memotime`.
  * More informative messages, especially in verbose mode.
  * Use WHO data cached localy in case of connection problems.
  * New functions: `get_counts()` and `get_init()` to get state membership counts.
  * Smart sex code conversion for `get_who_mr()`.

## Bug fixes

  * _really_ fixed problem when the argument to `discount()` was not defined as a parameter.
  
## Backend changes

  * `eval_model_newdata()`, the function behind resampling and sensitivity analysis now returns list-variables.
  
## Acknowledments
