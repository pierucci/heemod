\title{Fit survival models using different distributions}
\usage{
f_fit_survival_models(survdata, dists = c("exp", "weibull", "lnorm", "gamma",
  "gompertz", "gengamma"), time_col_name, censor_col_name, treatment_col_name,
  covariate_col_names = NULL, fit_indiv_groups = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{survdata}{Survival data to be used.}

\item{dists}{Distributional forms to be considered in fitting using
\code{flexsurvreg}.  By default, includes exponential, Weibull, 
lognormal, gamma, gompertz, and generalized gamma.  Kaplan-Meier
curves will also be stored automatically.}

\item{time_col_name}{Name of the column in survdata with event times.}

\item{censor_col_name}{Name of the column in survdata with censorship
indicators.   0:  event observed; 1:  censored.}

\item{treatment_col_name}{Name of the column in survdata that holds the
treatment group names (for example "control", "treatment", "dose1", and 
so on).}

\item{covariate_col_names}{Not yet implemented}

\item{fit_indiv_groups}{Should groups be fit individually?  Default TRUE.}
}
\value{
a matrix (with dimnames) of flexsurvreg objects, 
    with rows corresponding to
    the distributions, and columns corresponding to groups.
}
\description{
Fit survival models using different distributions
}
\details{
We don't return a special object for the Kaplan-Meier curve; that
    does not depend on the distribution, and can be obtained from
    any of the fitted objects by using the summary.flexsurvreg function
    with type = "survival".
