\title{Calculate additional metrics to evaluate fit of survival model.}
\usage{
f_calc_surv_fit_metrics(surv_fits, metrics = c("BIC", "m2LL"))
}
\arguments{
\item{surv_fits}{A list object from \code{\link{f_fit_survival_models}} that gives
a collection (list) of parametric survival fit object.}

\item{metrics}{Metrics to calculate.}
}
\value{
A list object of parametric survival fits, containing additional fields for
		the calculated fit metrics.
}
\description{
Calculate additional metrics to evaluate fit of survival model.
}
\details{
Currently calculates only:
		\itemize{\item Bayesian information criterion (BIC)
		\item -2*log likelihood (-2LL)}  (Objects come with AIC already calculated.)
