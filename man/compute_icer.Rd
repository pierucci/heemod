\title{Compute ICER}
\usage{
compute_icer(x, strategy_order = order(x$.effect), threshold = 30000)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Result of \code{\link{run_model}}.}

\item{strategy_order}{Order in which the strategies 
should be sorted. Default: by increasing effect.}

\item{threshold}{ICER threshold for net monetary benefit
computation.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with computed ICER.
}
\description{
Compute ICER for Markov models.
}
\details{
Models are ordered by effectiveness and ICER are computed
sequencially.
