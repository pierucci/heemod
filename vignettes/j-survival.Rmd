```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(heemod)
```
There are two ways to have `heemod` use survival models:

* by specifying, in text, a survival distribution with parameters; or

* by passing in fit survival models from package `flexsurvreg`.

We will demonstrate each of these in turn.

`heemod` currently supports the exponential (`exp`), weibull, lognormal (`lnorm`),
gamma, and beta distributions from the `stats` package, Gompertz (`gompertz`) and
generalized gamma (`gengamma`) distributions from the `flexsurv` package, and the
triangle distribution from the `triangle` package.

To enter survival distributions explicitly, use the \code{define_survival}
function:

```{r}
surv_dist1 <- define_survival(
  distribution = "weibull",
  shape = 2,
  scale = 5
)
```

Survival models fitted by the `flexsurv` package can also be used:

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
library(flexsurv)

fitw <- flexsurvreg(
  formula = Surv(futime, fustat) ~ 1,
  data = ovarian, dist = "weibull"
)
plot(fitw)
```

Probabilities can be calculated by passing these objects to `get_probs_from_surv`:
```{r}
get_probs_from_surv(surv_dist1, cycle = 1:5)
get_probs_from_surv(fitw, cycle = 1:5, km_limit = 2, cycle_length = 365)
```

These probabilities can then be used in defining parameters or other
parts of models.  In this simple model with only 1 strategy, the transition
from the first state to the second state is defined by the
explicitly defined Weibull distribution, while the transition from
the second state to the third state is defined by the fit object
from `flexsurvreg`. 

```{r warning=FALSE}
param <- define_parameters(
  p1 = get_probs_from_surv(
    surv_dist1,
    cycle = markov_cycle # can also be state_cycle
  ),
  p2 = get_probs_from_surv(
    fitw,
    cycle = markov_cycle,
    cycle_length = 365, # time is in days in fitw, in years in markov_cycle
    km_limit = 2 # use KM estimates during the first 2 years
  )
)

tm <- define_transition(
  C, p1, 0,
  0, C,  p2,
  0, 0,  C
)

plot(tm)

sA <-  define_state(
  cost = 10, ut = 1
)
sB <-  define_state(
  cost = 20, ut = .5
)
sC <-  define_state(
  cost = 0, ut = 0
)

stratTM <- define_strategy(
  transition = tm,
  A = sA, B = sB, C = sC
)

resTM <- run_model(
  parameters = param,
  stratTM,
  cycles = 10
)
```

```{r fig.width=6}
plot(resTM)
```

The example above uses an explicit distribution or a fitted survival model
to define elements of a standard Markov transition matrix.  It is also 
possible to define transitions not as matrices, but as partitioned survival models.

Partitioned survival models are frequently used to model the fate of cancer 
patients, and `heemod` deals, for now, specifically with that case.   A partial 
survival model requires two  `survival` objects, one for _progression free 
survival_, or pfs, for which the event waited for is tumor growth or death, and
one for _overall survival_, or os, for which the event is death. 
`define_part_surv` requires a `survival` object for each of pfs and os.   
By definition, anyone in progression-free survival is also in overall survival.
However, `heemod` will not check whether this condition is met when defining a
partitioned survival.  However, if the condition is not met, negative counts
will appear when the survival model is run, causing an error.

```{r warning=FALSE}
surv_dist2 <- define_survival(
  distribution = "exp",
  rate = .5
)

ps <- define_part_surv(
  pfs = surv_dist2,
  os = fitw,
  km_limit = c(0, 2), # 0 for pfs, 2 for os
  cycle_length = c(1, 365) # 1 for pfs, 365 for os
)

stratPS <- define_strategy(
  transition = ps,
  A = sA, B = sB, C = sC
)

resPS <- run_model(
  stratPS,
  cycles = 10
)
```

```{r fig.width=6}
plot(resPS)
```
